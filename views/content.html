<!--
This is a re-usable content template.  Since we only have two pages, we can easily predict the type of content that we're going to use, and create a simple HTML structure for displaying it.  In larger apps, this might be more robust.

We'll build it using some very simple HTML, and embed two Angular template tags.  Notice that these use dot-notation to access their content.  That should give you a clue as to how Angular parses data passed to the template.

<h1>{{page.pageTitle}}</h1>
<hr/>
<p class='lead text-muted'>
    {{page.description}}
