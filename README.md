# angular-demo-app
A simple demo app for all my friends who want to get an intro look at how to write an Angular app.

This app uses HTTP requests to pull mock data in from JSON files.  As a result, you'll need to run a server before interacting with the application in the browser.  Personally I like Python's Simple server.  In the project root, run the following command:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8000/ and you'll be good to go!
